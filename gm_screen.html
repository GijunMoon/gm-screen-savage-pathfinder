                <h2>Situational Rules</h2>
                <p><strong>Aim:</strong> Spend a turn aiming a ranged weapon. On the next turn, ignore up to
                    <strong>-4</strong> points of penalties (Range, Cover, Called Shot, Scale) or add
                    <strong>+2</strong> to the roll. Cannot take other actions while aiming.</p>
                <p><strong>Area Effect Attacks:</strong> Place the template and make an arcane skill or Shooting roll.
                    Targets in the template can attempt to Evade. Missed attacks may Deviate.</p>
                <p><strong>Breaking Free:</strong> From a grapple is an opposed Athletics roll. From a device is a
                    Strength roll, often with a penalty.</p>
                <p><strong>Called Shots:</strong> Attack a specific location for an effect. Penalties are: Limb
                    (<strong>-2</strong>), Head/Vitals (<strong>-4</strong>), Hand/Eye (<strong>-6</strong>). Success
                    causes a specific extra effect (e.g., target drops item, is Distracted).</p>
                <p><strong>Defend:</strong> Gain <strong>+4</strong> Parry but take no other actions that turn.</p>
                <p><strong>Desperate Attack:</strong> Gain <strong>+2</strong> to an attack roll (Athletics, Fighting,
                    or Shooting) but suffer <strong>-2</strong> to the damage roll.</p>
                <p><strong>Disarm:</strong> A Called Shot (<strong>-2</strong>) to a foe's weapon. If successful, make
                    an opposed Strength roll. If the attacker wins, the foe drops the weapon.</p>
                <p><strong>Deviation:</strong> A missed area effect may deviate. Thrown items deviate 1d6", projectiles 2d6". Multiply distance by 2 for Medium, 3 for Long, and 4 for Extreme Range. Roll a d12 for direction (like a clock face). A weapon can't deviate more than half the distance to the original target.</p>
                <p><strong>Evasion:</strong> Make an Agility roll at <strong>-2</strong> to avoid area effect attacks.
                    Success halves damage; a raise avoids it completely.</p>
                <p><strong>Finishing Move:</strong> A free attack against a helpless foe (<strong>+4</strong> to hit). A
                    successful damage roll slays the target, regardless of Wounds.</p>
                <p><strong>Firing into Melee:</strong> If a ranged attack misses its intended target, a random target
                    adjacent to the original (friend or foe) is hit instead on a <strong>1</strong> on the attack die.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Ganging Up:</strong> Foes gain <strong>+1</strong> to their Fighting rolls for each
                    additional adjacent attacker, up to a maximum of <strong>+4</strong>.</p>
                <p><strong>Grappling:</strong> An opposed Athletics roll to initiate. Success makes the target
                    Vulnerable. A raise makes the target Bound.</p>
                <p><strong>Hold:</strong> Postpone your action until later in the round. You can interrupt another
                    character's action by winning an opposed Athletics roll.</p>
                <p><strong>Illumination:</strong> Apply penalties to tasks requiring vision. Dim Light (e.g., twilight)
                    is <strong>-2</strong>. Dark (starless night) is <strong>-4</strong>. Pitch Black is
                    <strong>-6</strong>.</p>

            <div class="section section-no-header distribute-content">
                <p><strong>Improvised Weapons:</strong> Suffer a <strong>-2</strong> penalty to attack and Parry rolls.
                    Damage is typically Str+d4, with a max of Str+d6.</p>
                <p><strong>Innocent Bystanders:</strong> If a ranged attack misses and the attack die is a
                    <strong>1</strong>, a random bystander within 1" of the target is hit instead.</p>
                <p><strong>Mounted Combat:</strong> Mounted attackers get <strong>+1</strong> Fighting vs foot soldiers.
                    Riders must make a Riding roll to stay mounted when their mount is Shaken or Wounded.</p>
                <p><strong>Nonlethal Damage:</strong> Declare before the attack. A foe who takes a Wound from a
                    nonlethal attack must make a Vigor roll or be knocked unconscious.</p>
                <p><strong>Off-Hand Attacks:</strong> Attacks made with the off-hand suffer a <strong>-2</strong>
                    penalty.</p>
                <p><strong>Push:</strong> An opposed Strength roll. Success pushes the foe 1", plus 1" for each raise.
                    If pushed into an object, they may become Shaken.</p>
                <p><strong>Ranged Weapons in Melee:</strong> The intended target adds <strong>+2</strong> to their
                    Parry. Firing at another target requires an opposed Agility roll against all adjacent foes.</p>
                <p><strong>Reloading:</strong> A weapon with a Reload value takes that many actions to reload.</p>
                <p><strong>Rest:</strong> A full night of rest (approx. 8 hours) removes all levels of Fatigue. Sleeping
                    in
                    medium or heavy armor may prevent recovery and might even cause a level of Fatigue.</p>
                <p><strong>Surprise & The Drop:</strong> Surprised characters must make a Notice roll or be Shaken. If
                    an attacker has The Drop, they add <strong>+4</strong> to their attack and damage rolls, and the
                    target is Vulnerable.</p>
                <p><strong>Test:</strong> An opposed roll (e.g., Taunt vs. Smarts or Intimidation vs. Spirit) to make a
                    foe Distracted or Vulnerable.</p>
                <p><strong>Touch Attack:</strong> <strong>+2</strong> to a Fighting roll to simply touch a foe (often to
                    deliver a power).</p>
                <p><strong>Unstable Platform:</strong> <strong>-2</strong> penalty to most actions when on an unstable
                    surface.</p>
                <p><strong>Wild Attack:</strong> Add <strong>+2</strong> to a Fighting attack and damage roll, but
                    reduce Parry by <strong>-2</strong> until your next action.</p>
                <p><strong>Note:</strong> The <strong>+2</strong> bonus from Desperate Attack and Wild Attack do not stack with each other.</p>
                <p><strong>Withdrawing from Melee:</strong> Any adjacent foe gets a free Fighting attack against a
                    character who moves out of melee range.</p>

                <h2>Conditions</h2>
                <p><strong>Bleeding Out:</strong> Incapacitated characters must make a Vigor roll at the start of their
                    turn. Failure means death. A success keeps them alive. A raise stabilizes them.</p>
                <p><strong>Bound:</strong> Cannot move or perform any physical action. Parry is <strong>2</strong>. Can
                    attempt to break free with a Strength or Agility roll.</p>
                <p><strong>Disarmed:</strong> The character has dropped a held item. They must take an action to recover
                    it.</p>
                <p><strong>Distracted:</strong> Suffer <strong>-2</strong> to all Trait rolls. Removed at end of turn if
                    no other action is taken.</p>
                <p><strong>Entangled:</strong> As Bound, but may attempt to break free with a Strength roll at
                    <strong>-2</strong>.</p>
                <p><strong>Fatigued:</strong> <strong>-1</strong> penalty to all Trait rolls. A second level of Fatigue
                    becomes Exhausted (<strong>-2</strong>). A third level results in Incapacitation.</p>
                <p><strong>Grappled:</strong> A grappled character is Vulnerable. If the attacker got a raise, the character
                    is Bound instead.</p>
                <p><strong>Incapacitated:</strong> Cannot perform any actions and is removed from combat.</p>
                <p><strong>Natural Healing:</strong> After the “Golden Hour,” characters make a Vigor roll every five
                    days to
                    heal. A success removes one Wound, and a raise removes two.</p>
                <p><strong>Poisoned:</strong> Suffer effects of a poison. Usually requires a Vigor roll to resist. Effects
                    can include Fatigue, damage, or attribute penalties.</p>
                <p><strong>Prone:</strong> <strong>-2</strong> to Parry. Melee attacks against are at
                    <strong>+2</strong>; ranged attacks are at <strong>-4</strong>.</p>
                <p><strong>Shaken:</strong> Cannot take actions. At the start of their turn, they must make a Spirit roll
                    to recover. A success removes Shaken. A raise removes Shaken and allows them to act.</p>
                <p><strong>Stunned:</strong> Prone, <strong>-2</strong> Parry, cannot act or move. At start of turn, make
                    a Spirit roll to recover (at -2 if from physical damage).</p>
                <p><strong>Vulnerable:</strong> All actions against the target are at <strong>+2</strong>. Lasts until
                    the end of their next turn.</p>
                <p><strong>Wounded:</strong> Each Wound inflicts a <strong>-1</strong> penalty to Pace and all Trait
                    rolls (max <strong>-3</strong>). Three Wounds means Incapacitated. Within the “Golden Hour” (1
                    hr of injury), a Healing roll can remove one Wound (two on a raise).</p>

                <h2>Dramatic Tasks</h2>
                <p>Used to resolve complex situations under a time limit. The GM sets the skill, number of rounds, and
                    Task Points needed (usually 5). Each round, characters make a skill roll.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Success:</strong> Gain 1 Task Point.</li>
                    <li><strong>Raise:</strong> Gain 2 Task Points.</li>
                    <li><strong>Failure:</strong> No points. A <strong>Complication</strong> occurs (e.g., -1 penalty to
                        the next round's roll).</li>
                    <li><strong>Critical Failure:</strong> Lose one previously earned Task Point (if any). A
                        Complication also occurs.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Support:</strong> Allies can make Support rolls to aid the primary character. A success adds
                    <strong>+1</strong> to the lead's roll, and a raise adds <strong>+2</strong> (max total bonus of
                    <strong>+4</strong>).</p>
                <p>The party succeeds if they gather enough Task Points in time, and fails if the time runs out.</p>
